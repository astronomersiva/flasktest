### Hello

This is the source of my [website](https://siva.dev).

I initially set this up during my college days(~2013) and much
of the layout and styles haven't changed since then.

This site is built with [lego](https://github.com/astronomersiva/lego),
a Node.js based static site generator that I built for fun.

This site was originally built with Flask and I used Flask-Static-Compress
to generate static files from the contents.

I wrote this originally in Flask as I was deeply involved with the Python
community back then and I used to run several other apps with this.
Much of those apps no longer exist.

At one point of time, this site and the associated apps were being
served from AWS and I wrote a [blog](https://siva.dev/flask-aws/)
about the setup which you can read if you are interested.

I do a lot of experimentation with this site and some successful
ones have been made as separate projects that you can check out
on my Gitub profile. Some have even made it to my workplace :P
