          <p>
            I love writing applications that are user-friendly, accessible and performant.
            I currently work as a JavaScript Engineer at Zoho.
            I primarily contribute to web apps built with EmberJS and React at work.
            When not rolling out features or fixing bugs, I help in improving
            the performance of our web apps by addressing memory leaks and
            designing new patterns that could make our apps faster for our users.
            I build and maintain several internal tools and frameworks that are used
            by other developers as well. I also work on our deployment process
            and do a bit of DevOps when needed.

              I am a seasoned trekker and love the sounds and smells of jungles.
              I have done a few exploratory treks, opening up new routes in the
              South Indian mountains. Over the last 2 years, I have been frequenting
              the Himalayas and I absolutely love how magnificent those mountains are.
              I make it point to go there at least twice in the winters just to experience
              the raw beauty of the place without any tourists. The north eastern part
              of India is my second favorite choice these days. Each of the

                Seven Sisters</a>
              is so different and it is almost like visiting individual countries.
              India's diversity is huge and I would really recommend you to explore it :)

              I am also an avid astronomer and run the
              Chennai Astronomy Club with the help of other volunteers.
              We mostly do overnight observation sessions(aka

                Star Parties</a>
              ) from places
              far away from the city lights.
              My targets of choice are usually nebulae and galaxies and the very
              idea that I am looking at light that was emitted literally
              millions of years ago is exhilarating!
              We also do outreach events whenever time permits.

              Implemented core features for the Indian edition of <em>Zoho Books</em>,
              an online accounting software.
            </li>
            <li>
              Devised a <a href="/ember-differential-bundles/">technique to do differential serving of bundles</a> in EmberJS.
              This resulted in a reduction of 120kb in the initial bundle and an average of 300ms in
              JS Parse/Compile time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Optimised the <a href="/render-performance-improvements/">rendering performance</a> of our list pages by
              implementing novel approaches in combination with occlusion that brought down the rendering
              speed from ~1400ms to ~300ms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Introduced a <a href="/eagerly-prefetch-route-models-ember/">strategy to eagerly make API calls</a>
              based on users’ behaviour resulting in perceived speed improvements of several hundred milliseconds
              on routes with slow API calls.
            </li>
            <li>
              As a part of the Performance Team, spearheaded the discovery and fixing of several memory leaks in our
              Ember applications. Later trained developers in ways to avoid them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Established our Continuous Integration setup using GitLab CI that made it possible to ship
              our changes in under 20 minutes. This used to take several hours earlier.
