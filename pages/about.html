          I currently work as a Front End Engineer at Zoho.
          I primarily build applications with <a href="/tag/emberjs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EmberJS</a>
          at work. I also work on building internal frameworks and
          <a href="/tag/tooling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tools</a> that are used by other developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I mostly code in Javascript these days,  I am a huge fan of
          <a href="/tag/python/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python</a> and the clean,
          English-like syntax is what attracted me to programming in the first place.
        </p>

          Outside of work, I am very interested in travelling and astronomy.
          Whenever possible, I head out on exploratory treks,
          to places that have not been trekked before. These days, I have
          kind of run out of such places and as a result,
          I have started backpacking to offbeat places.
          I run the Chennai Astronomy Club, and we head out to some really rural places
          whenever the weather permits to observe the heavens. We also do outreaches for
          schools and orphanages and you can get in touch if you would like to suggest a place
          to conduct an outreach.
