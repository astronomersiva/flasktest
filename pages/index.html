        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
          My name is Siva. I currently work as a front-end engineer
          in Zoho.
        </p>
        <p>
          I contribute to web apps built with EmberJS and Preact at work.
          When not rolling out features or fixing bugs, I help in improving
          the performance of our web apps by hunting down memory leaks and
          trying new patterns that could make our apps faster to our users.
          I also built several internal tools and frameworks that are used
          by about a hundred developers everyday.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a seasoned trekker and love the sounds and smells of jungles.
          I have done a few exploratory treks, opening up new routes in the
          south Indian mountains. I am also an avid astronomer and run the
          Chennai Astronomy Club with the help of other volunteers.
