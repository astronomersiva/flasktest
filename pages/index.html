          My name is Siva. I currently work as a front-end engineer
          in Zoho.
        </p>
        <p>
          I contribute to web apps built with EmberJS and React at work.
          When not rolling out features or fixing bugs, I help in improving
          the performance of our web apps by addressing memory leaks and
          designing new patterns that could make our apps faster for our users.
          I also contribute to several internal tools and frameworks that are used
          by about a hundred developers everyday.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a seasoned trekker and love the sounds and smells of jungles.
          I have done a few exploratory treks, opening up new routes in the
          South Indian mountains. I am also an avid astronomer and run the
          Chennai Astronomy Club with the help of other volunteers.
