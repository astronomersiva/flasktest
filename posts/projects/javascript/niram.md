niram(Tamil for *color*) is an app that I built for learning React and CSS-in-JS.

niram lets you upload an image and displays the 5 most common color codes of that image.

Head out to the [demo page](https://astronomersiva.github.io/niram/) to try it out and [here is the repo](https://github.com/astronomersiva/niram), if you want to see the code or file an issue :)
