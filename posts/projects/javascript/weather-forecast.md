I have recently decided to do one fun project every weekend. This weekend, I decided to create a site that would fetch the visitor's location and display the weather forecast for that location.

I used the W3C Geolocation API for fetching the location and OpenWeather Map's API for fetching weather forecasts. I used an [awesome weather icon pack](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) by Erik Flowers for the icons. If you just want to see it working, then head [~~here~~](http://weather.sivasubramanyam.me).
