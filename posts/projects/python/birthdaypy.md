It was November 15, 2013\. I was liking and replying to some 150 birthday wishes on Facebook. Midway through, I thought of automating it with a Python script. I wrote one quickly but didn't use it then. I waited for this year and two days before my birthday I remembered this. I went back to the script and realised that I had written something really bad. Good that I didn't use it last year :D (Isn't it true that we all become better with time? I guess that's what is happening to me).

<div class="ajanta">
  <img
    class="img-responsive center-block pixelated blur"
    src="/static/images/lowres/birthday.jpg" 
    data-src="/static/images/birthday.jpg" 
    alt="Screenshot">

  <img class="img-responsive center-block original">
</div>

The day arrived and I ran the script. And Python did the magic exactly as I wanted. Feel free to play around with the script.
