Immediately after I created the [Facebook friends heatmap](/facebook-friends-heatmap/), I started to develop a craze for creating heatmaps. I made a similar one for the [Charlie Bates Solar Astronomy Project](http://www.charliebates.org/). It displayed the location of their members who participated in the International Sun Day. You can see that [here](http://www.solarastronomy.org/heatmap/sunday.html).

I also went ahead and used the publicly available earthquake database to plot all the earthquakes since 1990 to create a heatmap. As expected, all of them fell on the tectonic plate boundaries and I was also able to see the most affected parts.
