            I am an undergrad student at RMK Engineering College, Chennai. I am a self taught programmer and my arsenal includes C, C++, Python, PHP, MongoDB, Javascript, HTML and CSS. The weapon of my choice is Python, especially when I am trying to prototype some new idea. Speaking of a different kind of languages, I am proficient in English(I cleared the Business English Certification-Level Vantage with a CEFR level of C1), Tamil, Hindi and French.

            I love traveling to lesser known destinations and climbing mountains. This gives me a lot of inner peace and helps me to reconnect with the natural world. I am also a pretty good photographer. Some of my works have won awards at competitions and one of my photographs was featured in an international exhibition.

            I also co-founded the <a href = "http://chennaiastronomyclub.org">Chennai Astronomy Club</a>, one of the most active astronomy clubs in India. When I am not coding or traveling, you will find me gazing the stars with my telescope.
